title: How to enable the AI assistant in marimo notebooks

I’ve just published a step-by-step guide on how to enable the AI assistant in marimo notebooks using a local LLM model with Docker Model Runner, but is the same process if you are running your LLMs locally with Ollama.
I have also included a video on how to do the setup.

Running an LLM locally allows you to build with privacy and for free, giving you greater control over your projects and your data.
