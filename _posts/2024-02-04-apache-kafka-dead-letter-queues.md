If the message failed, would you miss it?  
Are you going to do anything with it?  

If not, then fine, you don't need the DLQ, just get rid of it.  
* Just handle the exception and move on.  
* Put it somewhere where it can be found and drop the message.  

Listen to this conversation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQDbX0agk-I&t=338s) with Tim Burgland  and Jason Bell.
